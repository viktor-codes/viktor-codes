# Hi there! 🖖 I'm Viktor Rura 👨‍💼 ![Typing SVG](https://readme-typing-svg.herokuapp.com?font=Fira+Code&pause=1000&color=36BCF7&width=435&lines=Full+Stack+Developer;Kitesurfer+%26+Photographer;Always+learning+new+things)

## 🚀 Full Stack Developer who thrives in the chaos

🏙️ By day, I build scalable web apps that can handle the ever-changing tides of the internet, no matter how many users come crashing in.

🌃 By night, I tackle complex problems like an octopus blending in, shifting gears, and always finding a solution.

📢 I speak both front-end and back-end languages, making me the ultimate translator for your web app dreams.

## ⚡ Fun Fact

When I'm not coding, you might find me kitesurfing across waves 🏄🏻‍♂️, freediving with the fishes 🐡, or busting a move on the dance floor 🕺🏻.

Oh, and I also have a knack for capturing epic moments as a photographer 📸 (because some problems are best solved with a lens, not code).
