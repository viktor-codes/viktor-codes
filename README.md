## Hi there!🖖 I'm Viktor Rura 👨‍💼

### 🚀 Full Stack Developer who thrives in the chaos.

🏙️ By day, I build scalable web apps that can handle the ever-changing tides of the internet, no matter how many users come crashing in.

🌃 By night, I tackle complex problems like an octopus blending in, shifting gears, and always finding a solution.

📢 I speak both front-end and back-end languages, making me the ultimate translator for your web app dreams.

### ⚡ Fun Fact

When I'm not coding, you might find me kitesurfing across waves 🏄🏻‍♂️, freediving with the fishes 🐡, or busting a move on the dance floor🕺🏻.

Oh, and I also have a knack for capturing epic moments as a photographer 📸(because some problems are best solved with a lens, not code).
