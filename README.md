### 🚀 Full Stack Developer | JavaScript Enthusiast | Problem Solver

Hi there!🖖 I'm Viktor Rura, a Full Stack Developer who thrives in the chaos.

By day, I build scalable web apps that can handle the ever-changing tides of the internet, no matter how many users come crashing in.
By night, I tackle complex problems like an octopus blending in, shifting gears, and always finding a solution.
I speak both front-end and back-end languages, making me the ultimate translator for your web app dreams.
When I'm not coding, you might find me kitesurfing across waves, free diving with the fishes, or busting a move on the dance floor. ‍♂️
Oh, and I also have a knack for capturing epic moments as a photographer (because some problems are best solved with a lens, not code).
